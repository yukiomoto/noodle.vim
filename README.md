# noodle.vim provides a minutes-timer feature

When you want to make some instant ramen or even when someone randomly asks you to time 10 mins when you are coding or whatever unexpected timing duty you got, you can handle this without leaving vim.

## Usage

To time 10 mins.

```
:Noodle 10
```

Its default value is 3 mins for a great reason.

```
:Noodle
```
